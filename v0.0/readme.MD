Well, this is the first kind of successful testing. It gives very good result with simple problems. But the more complex it gets, the worse the time and result.

You can use it by tweaking timetable constraints , and optimise results by playing around the algorithm parameters.


## findings and conclusions

* the algorithm is not efficient, there is so much unused and wasted ressources in invalid timtables. We should find better mutations that preserve the validity, and start with valid not optimised timetables. So basically the Genetic Algorithm only optimise which it does best, and we can guaratee that the output result will be also valid, which is strictly required.
