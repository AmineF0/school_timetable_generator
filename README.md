# school_timetable_generator
A project for generating timetables<br>

the project will be divided in lot of versions with an increasing complexity, this will allow a better understanding and mastring of the problem. <br>

The solution will use Genetic Algorithm for finding an optimal solution given that the problem is NP-Hard

## Versions :
* v 0.0 environment set up and testing
* v 1.0 primary school timetable generator
* v 2.0 higher education
* v 3.0 university
